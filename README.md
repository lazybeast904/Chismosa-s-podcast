## Las Chismosas Podcast
## Description
Podcast page where you can send in your on gossip for a chance it will be talked about and have an episode about it.
The motivation for this project came from one of the contributors.
This podcast is his wifes favorite to listen to so we wanted to make it more interactive for the listeners.
This will solve the problem of the creators trying to come up with content to talk about, they will be able to get storys from there lisenters.
We learned how to make a webpage that can retrieve new users, redirect them to what they should see after they log in, and making an interactive page that will store there stories.
## Usage
